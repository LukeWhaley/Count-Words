This is my submission for Assignment 13 for my Object Oriented Computing course. The program counts the number of times each word is repeated in the file "sample.txt" and writes the result to a new file called "result.txt". Words are not case sensitive: "Hello" and "hello" will be treated as the same word.

Example: If the input file contains "hello" in 3 lines, "world" in 5 lines, and "java" in 6 lines, the output will be: 
hello 3
java 6
world 5
